Analyzing ride share data and creating visualizations using python, pandas and matplotlib

## Challenge Delivering Results

![Challenge](Analysis/Challenge.png)

After finishing the presentation, I realized it would be good to gather some key metrics and plot fare data by city type on a weekly basis to discover business insights. Using the pandas and matplotlib libraries in conjunction I was able to combine the two datasets, preform analysis and create graphs to accomplish these goals.Some takeaways from the table and graph below is that total fares, average and weekly are great in Urban than Suburban city types and greater in Suburban than Rural city types. However, this is mostly due to the number of total rides as we can see from the summary table is that these relationship are actually reversed when it comes to the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver
